                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p> Hello! Welcome to my little corner of the web. I'm a software developer with unique roots. My
                    name is Janeé, pronounced just like Reneé but with a J.
                    I am an outdoor enthusiast who loves to explore new places and try new things. All of the photos
                    featured on this website were taken while visiting
                    some marvelous locations. Each location provoked a euphoric impression that has stayed with me
                    long after departure. I decided to share them in the hope that
                    they stir something special within you. I find a lot of inspiration from the timeless beauty of
                    nature. It's always changing and adapting to it's
                    surroundings, just like me.
                <br>
                <br>
                    I began my career in operations and quickly found a niche among exact calculations. After
                    spending ten years in the financial industry, I decided to spread
                    my wings and learn to code! I love the creativity and versatility that web development nurtures.
                    Do you have a design you'd like to execute but you're not
                    sure where to start? Reach out to me, I'd love to hear about it. Allow me to help develop the
                    foundation so you can concentrate on the overall success of
                    your project. I'm confident that we can work together to create something uniquely qualified to
                    meet your needs, whatever they might be. Thanks for stopping
                    by! I look forward to working together. </p>
